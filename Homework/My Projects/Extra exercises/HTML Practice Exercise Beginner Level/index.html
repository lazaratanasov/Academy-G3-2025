            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3><i>Why I love Interstellar</i></h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Interstellar</span> is more than just a science-fiction movie to me it’s an
                experience that stays with you long after the credits roll.
                What I love most is how it balances massive, mind-bending scientific ideas with an incredibly personal
                and emotional
                story. The film explores concepts like time dilation, black holes, and space travel, but it never feels
                cold or purely
                technical. Instead, it constantly brings the focus back to human relationships, especially love,
                sacrifice, and the bond
                between parents and children.
                </br></br>
                The movie also makes space feel both beautiful and terrifying. The vast emptiness, the silence, and the
                sheer scale of
                the universe really put human life into perspective. At the same time, Interstellar shows how curiosity
                and hope drive
                humanity forward, even when the odds seem impossible. The idea that exploration is part of who we are
                resonates deeply
                with me.
                </br></br>
                Another reason I love Interstellar is its emotional weight. The way time passes differently for the
                characters creates
                moments that are heartbreaking and powerful, reminding us how precious time really is. Combined with
                Hans Zimmer’s
                unforgettable soundtrack, the film manages to feel epic and intimate at the same time.
                </br></br>
                Ultimately, Interstellar is a movie that makes me think, feel, and question things about science, about
                humanity, and
                about our place in the universe. That combination of intellectual depth and emotional impact is what
                makes it one of my
                favorite films of all time.

            <h2>My List</h2>

            <h3>Top things I enjoy about the movie</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the things I enjoy most about Interstellar is how it combines science and emotion in a way
                    that feels natural
                    rather than forced. The movie introduces complex ideas like relativity and black holes, but it
                    always connects them back
                    to human experiences, making the story easy to follow and emotionally engaging.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I also really enjoy the visuals. The space scenes feel vast and realistic, and the attention to
                    detail makes the
                    universe feel alive. From distant planets to massive cosmic phenomena, every scene feels carefully
                    crafted and
                    immersive.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The soundtrack is another huge highlight for me. The music adds intensity and emotion to the story
                    without overpowering
                    it. It enhances both the quiet, reflective moments and the high-stakes scenes, making the experience
                    even more
                    memorable.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Finally, I enjoy how the movie makes you think. Interstellar doesn’t give simple answers — it
                    encourages reflection on
                    time, love, sacrifice, and humanity’s future. It’s the kind of movie that stays in your mind and
                    sparks discussions long
                    after you’ve finished watching it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What i before and after watching it</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before I start Interstellar, I prepare myself like I’m about to launch into space. I grab snacks,
                    silence my phone, and
                    make sure I won’t be interrupted for the next three hours. I mentally accept that I might not
                    understand everything the
                    first time, but I’m ready to pretend I do. I also remind myself that this is not a casual background
                    movie, blinking at
                    the wrong moment might cost me 10 years of plot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>After the movie ends, I sit in silence for a few minutes, questioning time, existence, and my life
                    choices. Then I
                    immediately go online to read explanations, timelines, and theories to confirm that I didn’t miss
                    something important (I
                    definitely did). I listen to the soundtrack while staring into space and confidently explain the
                    plot to my friends as if I fully understood it all along.</li>
